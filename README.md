# AlgoliaSwiftUI

This is a working example of the Algolia tutorial for SwiftUI. This tutorial can be found [here](https://www.algolia.com/doc/guides/building-search-ui/getting-started/how-to/declarative/ios/)

There are a couple of import statements missing in the tutorial. I have added these in and posted this repo to help anyone struggling with getting this example up and running.
